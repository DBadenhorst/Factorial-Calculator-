# Factorial Calculator

This is a Python program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the `factorial_calculator.py` file.

3. The program will prompt you to enter a non-negative integer for which you want to calculate the factorial.

4. If you enter a valid non-negative integer, the program will calculate and display its factorial.

5. If you enter a negative number, the program will display an error message as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
